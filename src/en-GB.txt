<p>
  This project is seeking to better understand how people perceive streets and surroundings in cities.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>As you can see in the example screenshots above, we will show you photos of streets and ask you to rate those streets based on a given criterion, such as walkability or pleasantness.</li>
  <li>There are five choices for each rating: awful, bad, neutral, good and great.</li>
  <li>Please click on a button to rate the image according to the criterion, or swipe the image towards the desired rating. You can also skip an image by swiping up.</li>
  <li>Follow your instincts when selecting a rating: we want to know how you feel about each presented scene.</li>
  <li>In case you make a mistake, there is also an undo button to return to the previous photo.</li>
  <li>Your progress through each criterion in the photo survey is shown at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ul>

You will be shown one large image, a rating category to consider, and three
small images (which are only present to give some context and feeling for the
place and do not serve any other purpose).  Each large image can be rated on a
5-point scale: awful, bad, neutral, good and great. You can rate by clicking
the buttons with smiley faces, or by swiping or dragging the image towards one
of the buttons. Swiping up means that you want to skip the current image and go
onto the next one.  There is also an undo button that lets you undo the last
action.
